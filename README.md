# EncryptionModel

Code implementation of a common encryption algorithm. The purpose of this project is to show the math behind
encryption algorithms and is not meant to be a tool for data protection. The algorithms used here aren't optimized
for real world use as the main focus is simplicity.

Example commands to encode and decode:
```
python main.py -m 64 -e -c 11 -p 1081

python main.py -m 852 -d -p1 23 -p2 47 -c 11
```
